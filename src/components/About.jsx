          Hello! My name is Bryan and I am currently on my first co-op as a Software Engineer at Barrett Distribution Centers!
          I am passionate about all facets of technology and utilizing tools to create platforms that can help benefit my community. 
          Throughout my time as a student, Iâ€™ve developed a strong understanding of algorithms, data structures, software development, and object-oriented programming.
          In my free time, I love to play basketball, hang out with friends/family, travel around the city and explore new places to eat!
